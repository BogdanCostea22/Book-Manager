# Spring Boot Microservice Project

This project is a Spring Boot microservice that demonstrates [brief description of what the service does].

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Java 21 or later
- Maven (optional, if you want to run without Docker)

## Running the Project

### Using Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BogdanCostea22/Book-Manager.git
   cd Book-Manager
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Start the services:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will start the Spring Boot application and any dependent services (like databases) defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. The application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in your Docker Compose file).

### Running without Docker

1. Ensure you have Java 17+ and Maven installed.

2. Build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   java -jar target/your-application-name.jar
   ```

## API Documentation

## Testing

To run the tests:

```
mvn test
```

## Future Improvements

### 1. Introducing Coroutines

To improve the application's scalability and performance, we can introduce Kotlin coroutines:

1. Add the coroutines dependency to `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlinx</groupId>
       <artifactId>kotlinx-coroutines-core</artifactId>
       <version>${kotlinx-coroutines.version}</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Convert blocking operations to suspend functions:
   ```kotlin
   suspend fun fetchData(): Data = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
       // Perform blocking operation
   }
   ```

3. Use coroutine scopes in your services:
   ```kotlin
   class MyService(private val coroutineScope: CoroutineScope) {
       fun processData() = coroutineScope.launch {
           // Asynchronous processing
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. Using a Reactive Database Client

To further enhance performance, consider using a reactive database client:

1. Add the reactive database driver to `pom.xml`. For example, for R2DBC with PostgreSQL:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>
       <artifactId>r2dbc-postgresql</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Configure the R2DBC connection in `application.properties`:
   ```
   spring.r2dbc.url=r2dbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
   spring.r2dbc.username=myuser
   spring.r2dbc.password=mypassword
   ```

3. Use reactive repositories in your data access layer:
   ```kotlin
   interface UserRepository : ReactiveCrudRepository<User, Long> {
       fun findByUsername(username: String): Mono<User>
   }
   ```

4. Adjust your services to work with reactive types:
   ```kotlin
   class UserService(private val userRepository: UserRepository) {
       suspend fun getUser(username: String): User? =
           userRepository.findByUsername(username).awaitFirstOrNull()
   }
   ```

By implementing these improvements, you can significantly enhance the application's ability to handle concurrent operations and scale effectively.
